# poweRbi
An R-based, httr-style interface for the Power BI REST API. Inspired by the work of libraries like twitteR and httr in R, 
this library aims to provide a useful set of tools for navigating the (fairly limited) Power BI REST API for their web services.

You will need to register an app before you can use this library: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-developer-overview-of-power-bi-rest-api/

#### Before installing:
This is still in development and fairly experimental. Much of the functionality is ready to use, so if there are any significant improvements
that can be made during this process then feel free to make changes and contribute as you please.
